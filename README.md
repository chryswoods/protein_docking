#Â protein-docking

1. Install [sire](https://github.com/michellab/Sire)
2. Activate the Python environment in which sire is installed.
3. Run using, e.g. `python main.py`

The `main.py` script shows how to use the functions defined in
`protein_docking.py`. This module will (eventually) contain
a set of functions that will let you 

1. load two proteins, 
2. combine them together into a single sire system,
3. add restraints between those two proteins
4. run a Monte Carlo minimisation to find the docked structure
